# Quokka

An Object Oriented programming language with a neat, complexity-free syntax.
Quokka compiles code into a simple bytecode format which is then interpreted for extra fast code interpretation, with a tested code execution speed of over 4 times faster than Python 3.8.

Quokka currently features 2 built-in datatypes (it will feature many more in the future), integer and string, which can be created with constants such as `53`, or `'some words'` (respectively).
