# Quokka

An Object Oriented programming language with a neat, complexity-free syntax.
Quokka compiles code directly into C for extra fast code execution, with a tested execution speed of approximately 4 times faster than Python 3.8.

Quokka currently features 2 built-in datatypes (it will feature many more in the future), integer and string, which can be created with constants such as `53`, or `'some words'` (respectively).
